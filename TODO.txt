input
  some format other than native Haskell
  use Parsec to parse?
  take variable names?

output
  pretty print answer
    make padding amount based on sizes, not hardcoded
      ideally, per-column
      better than nothing: based on whole matrix

internal
  recognize no solution, infinite solutions, unique solution
    unique solution has identity matrix on left
      or just default case if not either of the others
  add variable names to internal representation?
