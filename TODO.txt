input
  some format other than native Haskell
  use Parsec to parse?
  take variable names?

output
  pretty print answer
    make padding amount based on sizes, not hardcoded
      ideally, per-column
      better than nothing: based on whole matrix

internal
  recognize no solution, infinite solutions, unique solution
    no solution has contradiction
    infinite solution has more variables than equations
      be sure to prune any zero rows; they would cause false positives
    unique solution has identity matrix on left
      or just default case if not either of the others
  add variable names to internal representation?
